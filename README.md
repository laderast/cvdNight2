# CVD workshop night 2

Genetics and CVD: in `data/slides`

An example of using the machine learning package `caret` is available as `caretOnIrisData.Rmd`.

Your worksheet for tonight is available as `cohortMLAssignment.Rmd`.

Data has been partitioned into multiple sets and is available in the `data` folder.

##Outline for Night 2

## Task 4. An Introduction to molecular biomarkers (20 min)
**Learning Objective**: Discuss the potential impact of molecular biomarkers on a larger cohort. *Format*: [Short Lecture](slides/geneticsAndCVD.html) (15 min) + Questions (5 min)

## Task 5. Machine Learning/Modeling Tutorial (60 min)
**Learning Objective**: Use Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to explore subgroups and their CVD risk in the data. How well do we predict? What variables are useful in predicting CVD? How can we quantify this as a risk score? *Format*: [Short Lecture](caretOnIrisData.Rmd) (10 minutes) + [Interactive Workshop](cohortMLAssignment.Rmd). Tools used: R and visualization tools *Output*: Error + Risk Score
 
## Task 6. Discussion (60 min)
**Learning objective**: Students give a 1 minute presentation to attempt to answer the questions: Did we do any better? Is genetic testing worth it?
