# CVD workshop night 2

David Dorr and Ted Laderas

Genetics and CVD: in `data/slides`

An example of using the machine learning package `caret` is available as `caretOnIrisData.Rmd`.

Your worksheet for tonight is available as `cohortMLAssignment.Rmd`.

Data has been partitioned into multiple sets and is available in the `data` folder.

## Outline for Night 2

## Task 4. An Introduction to molecular biomarkers (20 min)
**Learning Objective**: Discuss the potential impact of molecular biomarkers on a larger cohort. *Format*: [Short Lecture](slides/geneticsAndCVD.html) (15 min) + Questions (5 min)

## Task 5. Machine Learning/Modeling Tutorial (60 min)
**Learning Objective**: Use multiple machine methods (through the `caret` package) to explore subgroups and their CVD risk in the data. How well do we predict? What variables are useful in predicting CVD? How can we quantify this as a risk score? *Format*: [Short Lecture](caretOnIrisData.Rmd) (10 minutes) + [Interactive Workshop](cohortMLAssignment.Rmd) (50 minutes). *Output*: Error + Risk Score
 
## Task 6. Discussion (60 min)
**Learning objective**: Students give a 1 minute presentation to attempt to answer the questions: Did we do any better? Is genetic testing worth it?
